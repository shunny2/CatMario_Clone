## About Application

<b>Cat Mario Clone</b> is a game prototype inspired by the well-known [Cat Mario](https://catmario.eu/). Released in 2007, Cat Mario is a 2D platformer game that has garnered attention for its challenging gameplay. Drawing inspiration from this, <b>Cat Mario Clone</b> aims to recreate the distinctive mechanics and the high level of difficulty that players have come to associate with the original game.

To achieve this goal, the project meticulously replicated key elements of Cat Mario's gameplay mechanics. The game offers an array of obstacles and traps, often appearing deceptively harmless, yet providing a formidable challenge to players. By closely emulating these mechanics, <b>Cat Mario Clone</b> offers players an opportunity to experience the thrill of overcoming intricate levels that demand both precision and strategy.

Currently, <b>Cat Mario Clone</b> stands as a prototype with a total of 5 meticulously designed levels. However, it's important to note that the game was developed solely for educational purposes, aiming to showcase the game design principles that have made Cat Mario a beloved classic. With its faithful reproduction of the original's challenging gameplay, <b>Cat Mario Clone</b> invites players to test their skills and embark on a nostalgic journey reminiscent of the iconic game it draws inspiration from.
